# TTB - Transport Tycoon Basic

A minimal browser prototype loosely inspired by Transport Tycoon Deluxe.
Simply open `index.html` in a modern browser to try it out.

## Controls
- Click tiles on the grid to build or remove roads.
- Create a connected path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner
  to watch the bus drive along your network.

## Files
- `index.html` – entry point HTML file
- `style.css` – simple page styling
- `main.js` – game logic running entirely in the browser

There is no build step or external dependency: all files can be served as-is.
